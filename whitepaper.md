# Mathematical Foundation of Function Dependency Graph Generation

This document outlines the mathematical foundation of the function dependency graph generator, focusing on the graph theory concepts involved.

## 1. Introduction

The function dependency graph generator analyzes source code to identify function calls and constructs a directed graph representing these dependencies. This allows for visualization and analysis of the function call hierarchy within a program.

## 2. Graph Theory Preliminaries

A directed graph, or digraph, $ G = (V, E) $ consists of a set of vertices $ V $ and a set of directed edges $ E \subseteq V \times V $. Each edge $ e = (u, v) \in E $ represents a directed connection from vertex $ u $ (the source) to vertex $ v $ (the target). In the context of function dependency graphs:

* **Vertices ($ V $)**: Represent functions within the source code.
* **Edges ($ E $)**: Represent a call from one function to another. An edge $ (u, v) $ indicates that function $ u $ calls function $ v $.

## 3. Graph Construction Algorithm

The algorithm for constructing the function dependency graph can be described as follows:

1. **Function Identification:** Parse the source code to identify all function definitions. Each identified function becomes a vertex in the graph. Let $ F $ be the set of identified functions, so $ V = F $.

2. **Call Identification:** Analyze the body of each function $ f \in F $ to identify calls to other functions. For each call from function $ f $ to function $ g $, add a directed edge $ (f, g) $ to the edge set $ E $.

3. **Graph Representation:** The resulting graph $ G = (V, E) $ represents the function dependency graph.

## 4. Graph Properties and Analysis

Several graph properties can be analyzed to gain insights into the code structure:

* **Cycles:** A cycle in the graph represents a sequence of function calls that eventually leads back to the starting function. This can indicate recursion (a function calling itself directly or indirectly). Cycles can be detected using Depth-First Search (DFS).

* **Connectivity:** A strongly connected component (SCC) is a subgraph where every vertex is reachable from every other vertex within the subgraph. SCCs can reveal tightly coupled groups of functions.

* **In-Degree and Out-Degree:** The in-degree of a vertex $ v $ is the number of edges pointing towards $ v $, representing the number of functions that call $ v $. The out-degree of $ v $ is the number of edges pointing away from $ v $, representing the number of functions called by $ v $. These metrics can identify central functions within the codebase.

## 5. Visualization

The generated graph $ G $ can be visualized using graph drawing algorithms, such as the spring layout algorithm used in the provided code. This visualization aids in understanding the overall structure and dependencies within the code.

## 6. Conclusion

The function dependency graph generator provides a valuable tool for analyzing code structure by leveraging fundamental graph theory concepts. By constructing and analyzing the dependency graph, developers can gain insights into function call hierarchies, identify potential issues like circular dependencies, and understand the overall organization of their code.
